### Background Image

Choose the Background Image Menu item, when the dialog opens, the only option is to Select the background image... Do so! 
[![](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/15-1024x507.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/15.png)
Follow the Select Image dialog and upload an image
[![](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/16-1024x717.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/16.png)
[![](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/19-1024x724.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/19.png)
Once the image is uploaded, there are lots of options.
[![](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-10-at-12.02.33-PM.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-10-at-12.02.33-PM.png)
Background Repeat determines how the image repeats on the background. If you select No Repeat, the image will display one time. Depending on it's size, it will only show at the top left of the background. Tiled, the image will repeat over and over filling the space that is the background. Tiled Horizontally, the image will repeat left to right. Tiled Vertically, the image will repeat top to bottom. In this case, the image I chose was a header image, 1024 px wide. It will cover the width of the image. Background Position determines if the image is aligned Left, Right or Center. In most cases, the background image is tiled, so that it covers the all of the background, but that depends on your preference. Background Attachment determines whether the background stays fixed or if it scrolls with the body copy. Experiment with the settings and decide what works for you. When you are done, click Save & Publish, then go back to the main Customization Menu.

### Editing Menus

Click on the Menu and that will bring you to the dialog that gives you the opportunity to chose menus.
